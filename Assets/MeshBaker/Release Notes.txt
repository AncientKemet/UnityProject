======================
Version 2.9

Moved all UnityEditor class usage to classes in the Editor folder
To do this an interface MB2_EditorMethodsInterface and class MB2_EditorMethods were created.
There were a number of changes to the API

MB2_MeshCombiner.Apply takes a delegate function for Generating UV2. This should be null when called at runtime and set to Unwrapping.GenerateUV2 when called from the editor.


These methods require an instance of MB2_EditorMethods when called from the editor. The parameter should be null or ommitted when called at runtime.
	doCombinedValidate
	CreateAndSaveAtlases

These methods were moved to MB2_EditorMethods
	SaveMeshsToAssetDatabase 
	RebuildPrefab
